# ⚠️ IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED - Database Connection Issue

## 🚨 Current Status
**Your Supabase database is PAUSED and unreachable.**

## 📋 What Happened
The error you're seeing:
```
Error: Failed to fetch categories: Internal Server Error
Can't reach database server at `aws-1-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com:5432`
```

This is because **Supabase free tier databases automatically pause after 1 week of inactivity**.

## ✅ QUICK FIX (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Wake Up Your Database

1. **Open Supabase Dashboard**
   - Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Log in with your account

2. **Find Your Project**
   - Look for project ID: `dzdgtmebfgdvglgldlph`
   - It will show as "Paused" or "Inactive"

3. **Restore the Project**
   - Click on the project
   - Click the "Restore" or "Unpause" button
   - Wait 2-3 minutes for it to become active

### Step 2: Test the Connection

After the database is active, run this command:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/test-db-connection.ts
```

You should see:
```
✅ Connected successfully
✅ Query executed successfully
✅ Database is connected and working properly
```

### Step 3: Restart Your App

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your app should now work! 🎉

## 🔧 What I've Already Fixed

I've improved your code to handle database connection issues better:

### 1. Enhanced Prisma Client (`lib/prisma.ts`)
- ✅ Added automatic retry logic
- ✅ Better error logging
- ✅ Connection recovery

### 2. Enhanced API Routes (`app/api/service-categories/route.ts`)
- ✅ Retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- ✅ Better error messages
- ✅ Returns proper HTTP status codes (503 for database issues)

### 3. New Health Check Endpoint (`app/api/health/route.ts`)
- ✅ Check if API is running
- ✅ Check database connection
- ✅ Can be used to keep database active

### 4. Enhanced Test Script (`scripts/test-db-connection.ts`)
- ✅ Comprehensive connection testing
- ✅ Helpful diagnostics
- ✅ Clear error messages

## 🛡️ Prevent This in the Future

### Option A: Upgrade to Supabase Pro (Recommended for Production)
- **Cost**: $25/month
- **Benefit**: Database never pauses
- **Link**: https://supabase.com/dashboard/org/_/billing

### Option B: Keep Database Active with Cron Job (Free)

Add this to your `vercel.json`:
```json
{
  "crons": [{
    "path": "/api/health?db=true",
    "schedule": "0 */6 * * *"
  }]
}
```

This pings your database every 6 hours to keep it active.

### Option C: Manual Wake-Up (Free but Inconvenient)
- Wake up the database manually whenever it pauses
- Not recommended for production

## 📊 Testing Commands

```bash
# Test database connection
npx tsx scripts/test-db-connection.ts

# Test API health
curl http://localhost:3001/api/health?db=true

# Test service categories endpoint
curl http://localhost:3001/api/service-categories
```
